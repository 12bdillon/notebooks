    "\n",
    "Algorithms are independent of any programming language or any computer they may be executed on. For example, [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for calculating greatest common divisors has clearly existed long before modern computers were invented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our study of algorithms will be both practical and theoretical. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, experience in designing algorithms and fluency with existing algorithms makes one a better problem solver. The best computer programmers and computer scientists tend to be the best problem solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, we will build up the ability to analyze algorithms. There can be multiple algorithms to solve the same problem. Which are most efficient? Efficient algorithms can solve larger problems and are more powerful than their less efficient variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will we study algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exploration of algorithms, we will examine practical examples. We'll look at existing algorithms and use them to establish our theoretical foundation for algorithm analysis. Along the way, we will introduce notations for algorithmic efficiency, algorithm design paradigms, and even the study of parallel algorithms."

    "If you execute the exact same program with the exact same input on two different computers, you will get different runtimes. For that matter, if you run the same program with the same input multiple times on the same computer, you will also get different runtimes due to different states of the computer at the times when it is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the different runtimes, the number of instructions executed didn't change. This is the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than evaluate algorithms based on their [\"wall-time\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elapsed_real_time), we focus on the number of operations required to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By counting the operations performed by an algorithm, we have a way of analyzing \"runtime\" independent of any hardware.\n",
    "\n",

    "To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we'll also abstract away particular input values. How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider linear search above. If the key is in the beginning of the list, the runtime is as small as possible. The algorithm checks the first element and immediately returns. If the key is not in the list, the runtime is maximal. Every element must be checked before the algorithm returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we want to ignore having to determine and consider all possible cases for potential input. We'll do this by only considering one, the worst possible case. We will perform our analysis by analyzing the behavior of the algorithm in the worst possible case. For linear search, we will assume that it will take as long as possible, namely that the key isn't in the list, and we will express the runtime for that situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering: Why assume the worst case as opposed to the best or some average case for runtime? \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the worst case allows us to provide guarantees on runtime. It is stronger to say that an algorithm will take no longer than $X$ rather than to say that it could run as quickly as $Y$. This is what we care about as users of algorithms and computer anyway. It is the lag in a game that is the problem, not all the time a game runs smoothly and flawlessly.\n",
