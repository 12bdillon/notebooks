There are many ways to solve every problem. Our goal as algorithm designers is to design the most efficient algorithm possible for any given problem. Although, I will admit, our first goal is usually just to get a working algorithm for the problem at hand.\n"

Just as before, we know that $a_2'$ is the second smallest element in the list, except now we know that the smallest element is already in the first position. Therefore we can find the second smallest element in the tail of the list from position two to the end. Once we find it, swap it into position.\n",

    "Now you get the idea. You may have gotten it already and I gone on too far! We continue this process until we work our way through the entire list. To put it succincly, for every position, we select the element that belongs there and swap it into place. This algorithm is called **Selection Sort**."
